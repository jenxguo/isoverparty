      "And here are two more essays that powerfully express the hope, heart, grief, and rage that are driving this moment of potential change. Racism Is Terrible. Blackness Is Not: Trayvon Generation: These Nashville teenagers are representative of the remarkable leadership were seeing from young people across the country and around the world. Today reminds us that progress might be slow. It might take decades. But no matter what things might look like today, its always possible. Happy Pride month, everybody. This young generation makes me optimistic about our future. By protesting, theyre speaking up and shining a light on injusticeand one way we can support them is to vote for people wholl change the laws on every level. In Columbia, Maryland, young people wielded social media to connect across boundaries, amplify voices, and enact some real change. This group of Nashville teens led a peaceful march with tens of thousands of people in their community. Over the past few weeks, weve seen young people in every corner of the country step up and become leaders. Through organization and mobilization, theyre showing us how we can sustain this momentum to bring about real change. Its too early to tell if its permanent, but the changes brought on by COVID-19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives. As has always been true at key moments in history, its going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible.I couldnt be prouder of all the young people leading that change right now. Heres my advice for the Class of : Weve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injusticebut we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to , Bryan Stevenson, and activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we to honor the victims and survivors of gun violencewhich continues to disproportionately harm Black communities. Then keep speaking up, voting, and changing laws across the country. Third, every city in this country should be a community. We have cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now: In our town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From , it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests. Second, a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change in a community like Ferguson with a history of blatant discriminatory law enforcement practices. Heres a useful reada reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors. \"Lets do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice dont matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who youre voting for. And thats how we're going to hit 'em.\" Lets get to work. I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts. If you want to take concrete action, but youre not sure how, weve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations whove been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. . The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away. . So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isnt between protest and politicswe have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform. . To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels. . The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices. . The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violencenot the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support. Ultimately, its going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering: As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, Ive heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change. I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real changeand pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. My statement on the death of George Floyd: If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Heres a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election: On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but its even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19.The way they lived, in service to one another, should be our roadmap in the months ahead. And heres more on the approach Sweden has taken, which differs from some of its neighbors: South Korea has focused on testing to guard against outbreaks: As all states begin the process of reopening, here are three articles that offer some lessons from other countries about the tradeoffs and policies involved. First, heres what European nations have done to support workers: The Class of is full of the leaders we need to bend the arc of history toward a better futureand our HBCU grads have the talent, skills, and vision to lead that change. I couldn't be prouder of all of you. As Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. Its one of the things I love most about the cityand one of the many reasons its such a good home for the . Congrats to the high school Class of , as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family whove guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! Congratulations to the HBCU Class of ! Michelle and I are so proud of you. As you set out to change the world, well be the wind at your back. Cant wait to see what you achieve. Graduating is a big achievement no matter what, but with all that the Class of has dealt with to get across the finish line, I think theyve earned a little celebration. I hope youll all join me in honoring them at PM ET and PM ET. Michelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so were reading The Word Collector for . Its a fun book that vividly illustrates the transformative power of wordsand we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Despite all the time thats been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now. Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from , to start engaging in our civic life today, were already creating something better for tomorrow. Even if you cant give the moms in your life a hug today, I hope you can give them an extra thank you today. Thank you and Happy Mothers Day to the woman who makes it all possible. Love you, . Theres no limit to the devotion Ive seen in teachers like these educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldnt be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. Ive always loved joining commencementsthe culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we cant get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. The folks of the Chicago food banks in communities like yoursare working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families whove fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; theyre helping us build a more equitable future for all. If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. Its not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virusbefore it's too late. We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. Parents, you deserve a break Michelles got storytime handled every Monday. Shes one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.) Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each otheras neighbors and as citizens. When I think of people Ive counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of , and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Heres a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals nows the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at . And Ill see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can. Im proud to endorse my friend for President of the United States. Let's go: Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenshipas they are Americans in every way but on paper. We can't deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It's a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions. Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hopea reminder of rebirth and renewaland a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. Lets not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. Everyone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. No one should be forced to choose between their right to vote and their right to stay healthy like the debacle in Wisconsin this week. Some good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. Its critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and theyll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work. Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish peopleand all of humanityof the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually. Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring something we have yet to put in place nationwide. My advisor and friend has been someone Ive turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world.

Filling out the Census determines what the next decade will look like for your community: your roads, health care, schools, representation and more. Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a -year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he startedthat journey to justice. What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, We aint going back. Weve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice. Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family. During this crisis, our grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, transit and utility workersalong with so many othershave been selflessly getting up every day to make sure we have the things we need.

And this article provides a great example of the kind of community spirit that we need to get through thisa spirit that we can hopefully learn to instill more of into our lives, workplaces, civic institutions, and government once the crisis has passed. Heres a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sakefor theirs. Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home.
