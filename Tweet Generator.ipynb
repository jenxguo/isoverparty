As much as I dont like them, Im willing to accept that I probably dont know whats best for public health better than they do Youre right. Every scientist and doctor with a pulse is wrong. Noted I own my own business that before all this was working all over the country. You think this isnt effecting that? Im willing to make some sacrifices and deal with the shit if it means people are safer because of it. Does it suck? Yeah it fucking sucks. Bad. Who doesnt want that? Nobody wants to deal with any of this. The fact that this has become a political issue is absurd. If people wouldve listened to the doctors and scientists in the beginning like they did in every other civilized country in the world wed be a lot better off This mf is a simp let's cancel him I follow you because you used to at least have a sensible argument to prove your point. This is all based on you and like minded people being inconvenienced and the feeling that the world owes you sports and haircuts, safety be damned for everyone else. Yeah they are illegal because they put people in danger? Kind of my point. Filling a stadium puts people in danger. If Im shooting my shotgun and some idiot is standing in my yard watching and gets shot, guess who goes to jail Your argument from the beginning has been to scoff at any and all precautions. And please dont act like you give a flying fuck about Joe the hotdog guy at a Rangers game all of the sudden. You want sports.. whatever it takes I absolutely do not have that right. You dont even have the option to not wear a seatbelt. I cant legally go outside and shoot skeet in my backyard with my gauge even though its likely nobody will get hurt. I cant drive drunk down a dirt road legally I have never once said these protests are going to be good for the spread so Id appreciate it if you didnt put words in my mouth. However, percent of the people seen protesting are wearing masks. That is undeniable. At least they have done what they could while protesting Tell Karl Anthony Towns hes lucky he probably already had it so he can play some sports ball as soon as possible to appease fans who couldnt give a fuck less about him or his family Sports are apparently so important in this country and people are so inconvenienced without them that we must throw all logic out the window to get them back. Players and their families safety be damned.

I think \"isoverparty\" should be banned on Twitter's trending page. It is not healthy to participate in them whatever the outcome. It is all spreading unreasonable toxic hate. Then when there is evidence apologies start rolling around and people defend their hate on mere beliefs. Scooter is over party ! is over party Wow. To whom do I address this very serious and personal attack?

There are a lot of annoying things on this app but the top of the list currently are these trends where you have to scroll through annoying-ass tweets from K-Pop stans to find out what insignificant bullshit somebody is being dragged for today. Could twitter develop a tool for specifically muting \"isoverparty\" from showing up in my trends? That'd be great. also cancelling doesnt happen, people just get called out for things & have a -isoverparty hashtag for a day Every time I get on here theres a X is over partyEverybody when theres a \"...isoverparty\" and the kpop stans arent posting their fancams like they do in other 's we rlly cant go a single day without a new ______ is over party tag can we me after seeing doja cat is over party : Please tell me wildcards work for muting because I swear to god there has never been a \"isoverparty\" hashtag that hasn't been absolutely annoying petty bullshit and I'm sick of it.

I just found out why Doja Cat is over party is trending Take a shot every time ____isoverparty is trending is there a way to filter out any hashtag that ends with isoverparty at this point lol Cancel Culture is not real. These trends are pointless. Might just start sharing this whenever [INSERT CELEB]ISOVERPARTY is trending xx Look on the doja cat is over party trending, shes apparently made a troll song about black people being killed by the police, hates being black,loves white coc,and she goes on chat rooms with these white racist guys and apparently shows pum pum /7 If I see one more fucking trending, Im going to write a strongly-worded thinkpiece on Medium about cancel culture that no one will give a shit about.But seriously, these over parties dont seem to have any basis in reality anymore - is everyone that bored?

These \"____isoverparty\" hashtags hurt. Why do they keep coming back? No one is safe from the \"is over party\" it's getting ridiculous Some bored kids who want clout and clicks. They'll use a popular celebrity at the moment, put his name in this __is over party hashtag. Include their silly kpop fancams in their posts & include the same hashtag in all their replies. When they get replies, it's a win for them. if I see one more on here I'm deleting this app. luna y flor is over party I dont agree with ANY kind of stan trending that someone is over party just to get views on fancams, I know it wasnt kpop stans this time Im just saying in general. Thats immature and what makes people think of us the way they do now, please stop. if i see one more isoverparty trending stg pee pee is over party Dear Stan Twitter: Fuck off with your stupid so-and-so is over party.

If Twitter wants to create new features, they should let us permablock any trending tags we don't want to see.I would love to never see anything related to sports, and I would physically pay money to never see anything XYZ-Is-Over-Party tag, especially when it's just Kpop spam. Every time I log onto this site \"______isoverparty\" is trending and I instantly age another years. Don't y'all get tired? By the by, if I ever tweet something about \"_ is over party\" or \"Cancel _\" that isn't , shoot me directly in the frontal lobe and then find me. Also, people are way too bored out of their minds in this quarantine... like just look at the trends the whole had ended and out of nowhere now EVERY SINGLE DAY there is someone trending under false accusations... people are hella bored and making up crap why can't we hold people accountable in a way that doesn't involve trending a stupid hashtag about them on Twitter filled with confusing messages that don't even give any reason as to why we are \"cancelling\" them? I look on my trending and see __ is over party and ??? Is over party youre all fucking or with no careeers bye Everyday I see a new someone or something is over party or canceled hashtag. Its so fucking weird. People are so weird. over party is over party Every day is a someone is over party. ._. Nope, heck no. You leave Cap outta this stupid \"is over party\". Like seriously there isnt a real reason to cancel him, so back off. This _insert celebrity here_isoverparty has finally crossed the line. can yall kpop stans PLEASE stop trending ___ is over party every time you want to get fancam views, can yall please just make ur OWN tag to trend instead of trying to bring down random celebs/influencers for no reason ?? Im laughing because this is like the furthest thing from the Chris Evans is over party like what? At this point I've just started to report the \"______ is over party\" for spam because that's genuinely all it is, the retard side of the K-pop fandom going absolutely rabid trying to get people to Stan their favourite band, or morons who dig up shit from years ago. No one cares. They're bored idiots simply chasing for clout & clicks. They see the celebrities trending the most & use in their ___is over party hashtag. the only reason why hashtags that say a certain celebrity is \"over party\" is because everyone who loves them goes on twitter and asks why it's trending. it's trending because you keep using the hashtag to ask why the hashtag is trending. that made no sense to u, but it did to me Every day there's a new \"isoverparty\" get a life. Get outside or something, Jesus. why do people think the ____isoverparty hashtags are serious like girl u making the tag trend even more by complaining abt it when an isoverparty hashtag trends and it's full of fancams as always and ppl are still popping blood vessels over having to scroll past videos of people dancing ???? like what'd you expect ???? y'all just want to be mad at this point like you knew full well what u were gonna see Is there any way I can block the words \"is over party\" from my feed? Its usually a bunch of dumb kpop accounts and the same gifs. I'll be totally honest, im done this \"isoverparty\" culture vic is over party I'm % sure that \"is over party\" hashtags are actually jokes to promote the person being \"cancelled,\" cuz I can never figure out how it started or why it's problematic. All related tweets are either fans defending the person (without explaining why) or random k-pop gifs. the people who get pissy about every \"[celebrity]isoverparty\" tag are astronomically more annoying than the stans who start them Just imagine how much better this bird app would be if we could get rid of this stupid X is over party trend. Im not asking for much here, people. AND WHEN THE ITZCLTS IS OVER PARTY HAPPENS THEN WHAT ugh another stupid trending. Why not IWBENFIDFVG NOOO NOT CHRIS EVANS IS OVER PARTY HAS ANYONE TOLD LIA GET THE VADER FANCAM READY im making a petition to stop letting people randomly trend __isoverparty because all of the people they cancel dont even do anything and they just trend it for fun its so annoying im tired of seeing it can't you guys find a better way to promote your fan cams than creating and spamming these \"-- is over party\" hashtags. No one will stan your celebs if this is how their fans act, and I'm sure the celebs you stan despise this as much as every other person. i think my favorite thing is coming on twitter everyday to a different Chris evans has been canceled. The trend is ridiculous, and same goes for pretty much every \"______ is over party\" hashtag. Those are examples of cancel culture going too far. Why am i seeing ChrisEvans is over party? \"*insert celebrity here* isoverparty idk what he did but stan *insert celebrity here* instead\" lmao if you tweet this YOURE A LOSER . Can you please create a new filter option in settings to block K-Pop posts with inane fan cams hijacking all trends, anyone using the word Stan for fan, and any and all ____isoverparty trends. Cheers It's kinda inevitable though. Kpop stans are quick to use a \"____isoverparty\" hash tag and post a video of their favorite artists, so they can get views. It's obviously annoying and irrelevant to the hash tag. Lana del ray is over party If it ever had any meaning the \"X is over party\" hashtag has lost it, every day (sometimes more often) we get a new one and often it's impossible to see what even the reason is. Too hard to keep up and mostly it's for nothing so it's just people arguing if someone is or isn't. I'm soooo tired of these *insert whoever*isoverparty trending only to be met with random kpop fancams MAKE IT STOP i swear everyday i see a new -isoverparty does twitter not get tired of cancelling people ?? My interpretation of these \"______ is over party\" hashtags that somehow get on trending, in today's case Chris Evans:1. People saying \"idk what's going on but [do unrelated thing]\"2. random videos of other celebrities3. those of us confused about it never get an explanation is over party Waiting for my Morris is over party funny how now whenever i go through the ______isoverparty hashtags its % local fancams and then locals blaming it on kpop stans when its not lolllll Can we just have a is over party Me whenever theres a new Is OvEr PaRtY hashtag this whole chris evans is over party is fucking ridiculous but i am BEGGINGGGG YALL to learn what a zionist is bc you guys seem to want to jump straight over the border to anti-semitism over a nuanced discussion every time you get a chance I have come to the conclusion that all of the \"__isoverparty\" hashtags are all just a ploy for k-pop stans to plug their boy/girl band stuff because they have nothing better to do with their lives chris evans is over party is trending The only parties people are having these days are ________isoverparty trends everyday why oh why am I seeing a ton of hate with this silly tag? -------> chris/evans/is/over/partyPeople really just like to be hateful for no reason huh? bad words lana is over party why do I always click those X is over party hashtags even though I know I will learn nothing why is there a *celebrity* is over party hashtag every day on this godforesaken bird app Twitter is a fresh, piece of Hell like you've never experienced w/a level of censorship worthy of rd Reich,First day of Twitter guy!_______ is over party, is a DAILY occurrenceIt's not ~he's just the Twitter victimdu jourEnjoy to the fake af, at this point I'm firmly convinced the \"is over party\" hashtags are artificially inflated by bots until they trend and then people just keep them going by posting the most random-ass shenanigans they can muster up don't u just love scrolling through a /'x'isoverparty hashtagand being able to count the amount of kpop fancams on one hand yet other fandoms are loud and proud with their 'stan this person' posts and editsyet we still get the hate and get blamed, the xenophobia popped I swear to fucking god if i see another certain person is over party I'm going to scream And now you know the secret: all isoverparty threads are KPOP fancams. is there any way to block those endless stupid \"X is over party\" hashtags from showing up? And kill anyone who starts one automatically? The WHO is over party ?? Not my boy Captain America I know THAT for sure Lets have a and end the dumbest hashtag forever i don't really care about the /____isoverparty but chris evans...really?

Every week or so it seems like people take offense to something some celebrity does, then they use the hashtag \"So and so is over party.\" Right now it's Shane Dawson is Over Party, but I refuse to tweet the hash tag. I guess it's like saying they're cancelled. Ugh me seeing another trending for the th time this year Shane Dawson is over party trending like he hasnt been over for years at this point cancel culture is only relevant on stan twitter tbh, as much as you try and start the - is over party and shit locals will still buy the music and they will always have a platform. sad reality noo vico is over party trending the stupid hashtag once a fucking day does absolutely nothing to youtubers and people with a giant following. Like it will never taint their fucking careers because of how large of a following they have. The drama lasts like a week and then it disappears+ the ____ is over party is always distracting, it calls to me, but all it will provide i predict is kpop fancams or w/e Everyday another *blank* is over party. He isn't going to be over, just like joji was over. Twitter exhausts me. Why'd I even come back to this platform? KPop is cancer and I view every \"isoverparty\" hashtag simply to block a ton of Kpop fancam accounts. Every day Im on Twitter I see x is over party and every day its some shit whoever did + years ago instead of something recent and Actually Problematic like I know were all bored with whats going on but damn chill a bit let ppl grow instead of bringing up old news ppl will be like shane dawson is over party!!! and then bring up the cat joke and the pedophila thing that his apology too was like...perfect?? much better than most things that are that caliber. YET THE BLACKFACE...THEY DONT TALK ABOUT THE BLACKFACE shane is over party is still trending huhweirdos Hashtag mia is over party day put a hashtag in front like so and so is over party isudhcncidj another shane dawson is over party? arent y'all tired of doing that every months just get it over with already Bruh Twitter is so fucking dumb if I log on one more time and see ...iSoVeRParTY one more fucking time, Im deleting the app Twitter should honestly filter out the \" ___ is over party\" trends. it's literally just spam. can we PLEASE stop with the isoverparty tags because most of the time its taken over by fancam spammers and i can never find out the reason for the tag I usually think the X is over party is bullshit and repetitive, but Shane honestly deserves it. Like out of anyone, he deserves it the most saw an old tweet from where they said fuck gay ppl Do you think someone can just build a bot that picks a random somewhat familiar personality and attaches it to _______? We can fuel it on Twitter hatred. As a pro-wrestling fan I have to confess that all of these 'Thing/Person is OVER party' trending hashtags are very confusing at first glance. exactly! theres nothing else he can do about it. this is whats annoying about the _____isoverparty yeah whatever they did isnt okay but what do you want them to do?? whoever the person isnt just gonna stop being famous I hate all these \"isoverparty\" hashtags. Like why the fuck are we celebrating everybody's downfall? Instead of letting people grow this app just brings up old shit about every single celebrity and refuses to accept any apologies. At this point Im just gonna mute the phrase isoverparty cuz every damn day its someone new and every damn time its literally just people bored outta their minds trying to start drama and ruin careers for fun It used to be funny now its the same thing as simp Bringing up shit from the past just to make a BLANK is over party hashtag? THAT NEEDS TO STOP. YALL ARE SUCH GROSS HUMAN BEINGS FOR NOT LETTING ANY YOUTUBER LIVE THEIR LIFE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING CANCELLED Tbf __________ should not have a career after what __________ did honestly is so disgusting pedo de pato is over party istg every says someone is over party is trending Can u guys stop making [insert person] is over party trending? I thought we were done with this cancel culture shit. this is so true honestly bc before this app i never saw the whole cancelling thing as a bad thing but Every Single Day theres a new ___isoverparty and when someone makes a single mistake they get attacked no matter what. no one is ever satisfied. its all cherry-picking. If you unironically tweet because of some shit from a decade ago, youre a baby dick loser I'm fucking tired of seeing ___isoverparty is so Fucking dumb, why is canceling someone even a thing, for fucks sake, can we just not cancel anyone anymore (I don't watch or like Shane Dawson but it's so dumb to see overparty ) quit lying i know yall kpop stans started \"isoverparty\" what the fuck is a \"person is over party\" please shut the fuck up im tired weird how that misinformed \"dark side of k-pop\" stereotype has been spread so far that literally everyone thinks it is representative of the entire industry.and also the generalization of k-pop stans by assuming that we all participate in the /isoverparty and spam fancams... yall im so confused whats going on this time why is there another ___ is over party help Fargan is over party ahre Hate seeing shit like fill in the blank is over party trending because i can never find out why with everyone clogging it with fancams but i think today its just people being reasonably mad that shane dawson still has a platform and yeah he shouldnt have one im tired seeing this shit \"isoverparty\" like you kpop stans cancel anyone for the shittiest reason you can think. thats what you did with rich brian, joji, brockhampton, and more. Look at all the \"is over\" party hashtags, see how crazy the kpop stans went when they found out who joji was before his music career, or how when h3h3 criticize kpop and its community that there was an over party for him too? Not to mention, stans are very intolerant. Can we just start an is over party? This guy represents everything that was wrong with the sport and his continued presence in the game makes me cringe. hashtag sissa is over party stop with the tweets bruh u guys are not cancelling anything People are so bored during that every hour I see a so and so is OVER party.

It's just so damn annoying and it doesn't even do anything to the person they're trying to cancel. I just want this to stop Kpop stands need to stop trying to cancel people There's always a new \"is over party\" trending everyday Chucha is over party Why do kpop stans always Do a \"is over party\" every week. I understand youre kids and think fancaming is a good thing but it just makes your community look more toxic than it is. Just please Stan and don't be toxic as you are now.

You might be the next trending. every single time, every single month It's always this (Insert Popular Person)IsOverParty. Like shut up already you are accomplishing nothing and nothing changes. Can I get an \"isoverparty\" hashtag? Dude, for real... SOOOOOOO sick of \"Covid-19\" DOMINATING the Twitter feed... and politics. It's Covid, \"isoverparty\", or \"hate Trump/love Trump\" crap.

An apology? Because nothing ever comes from them and theyre seen as a joke. I wish I could mute part of a hashtag. Like isoverparty so I dont have to see it for any fucking person ever Anyone written about , what seems to be, kpop stans over the last few months getting is over party to trend on Twitter practically every day? Might not be the case! But its always a YouTuber. I would love to read about why/what/how this keeps happening/so frequent right now. Jesus.

Okay I dont like Shane Dawson at all but the IsOverParty hashtags are getting old... I love it when I see a \"someone is over party\" trending and I have no idea who that person is in the first place. Feels good. Feels right.

At least we never trend someone is over party. i wish i was still studying psychology this fall and not something else bc i really want to know the thought process behind these trolls?? like this is a new level of disturbing. this is beyond starting \" is over party\" hashtags and saying \"maybe if they stanned __\" I hate the [Insert Anyone Here] Is Over Party hashtag. It's just mean. We need empathy more than ever and those kind of hashtags just bring more mean spirited energy into the world. So... stop? anyone else get annoyed when they see a tag of _____isoverparty because everyone starts assuming its kpop stans starting it for no reason when we dont,, and they think we say maybe if they stanned _____ they wouldnt have ______ when in reality its troll accounts I honestly dont get why people are cancelling Shane Dawson. Not because I like him, but because so many people (especially K-pop stans) have tried to do the is over party hashtag with little to no success. How hard is it not to be a part of cancel culture with your pathetic fucking grow up and rub some lavender between your fingers, maybe you'll calm down Half of the people who used this tag only want views for their stupid fancams. Just remember when there's a (name)isoverparty turn autoplay off. I wonder who started that [name]isoverparty trend. also goes for any other [name]isoverparty.It's spammy bullshit that never actually gets results and is never focusing on things the person is currently doing, but rather the fact that they shit their pants when they were . ok but why do we ____ is over party. if someone did something wrong they should be called out for it and actually like, apologize. instead of being paraded around twitter once every month Every time I see a hashtag trending that ends with \"IsOverParty\" I get brought slightly closer to suspending this account and turning into a well-adjusted, boring something honestly at this point I should just stop pressing the hashtags Ill find nothing than fancams and toxicity there how many is over party hashtags are there? twitter... i dont give a shit if woody harrelson started this shits annoying Im glad. Apparently the Texas supreme court has decided the pandemic is over.. party on. Its because they do all of the other so and so is over party hashtags to clarify the kpop stans start a hashtag then whenever people like start posting on it the kpop stans come in and fucking start posting fan cams like it was a trap and you just got baited Im not even exaggerating at this point every fucking day is trending and im so sick of it like shut the fuck UP Because if \"(name)isoverparty\" is trending, % of the posts will be k-pop fancams or \"Should've been stanning (insert k-pop celeb here). I'm just laughing over the fact that the Twitter Algorithm now identifies that if \"(name)isoverparty\" is trending, k-pop is involved Please don't allow this behavior to continue and grow. Before something bad happens and people get hurt. And I don't think I want to see you with a \"isoverparty\" on the trends list. So please don't do this again unless it it educated people on their message and achievements. theres a shane dawson is over party like every month, yall really need to calm down Hey, , please implement a way for me to block any and all content that contains the text isoverparty. Thanks. So how many times are people gonna start a Shane Dawson is over party and then still continue to watch his videos and stuff like what mfw seeing \"_______IsOverParty\" with a kpop tag attached to it every other day we have a shane dawson is over party every months is he dead yet why tf is shane dawson is over party trending at least once a week Twitter gets such and such is over party.. and I don't even know they were a thing and now they're already over..(also maybe the whole such in such is over is just.. dumb?) I don't get the ______IsOverParty thing They never work i hate the fancams, i hate the ____isoverparty, i hate the mob mentality. i think i just hate high school stans i've never listened to kpop though and i don't have a problem with the music! why's *SOMEONE* is over party trending everyday yall are so jobless..like literally lmfao.. ...like throw an party? *sigh* as an army, the fancam culture doesn't exist for us (except if they are multifandom), i didn't saw armys do a *isoverparty trend and we can trend a lot of things. We are respectful but don't insult bts.And again i said armys not kpop stans. shane dawson is over party again? lesss go Why does every \".... is over party\" ends up being kpop fans promoting their faves and posting fancams These things are getting super fucking annoying Me and the boys are driving up to London tomorrow to score the REAL final goal at Griffin Park. is over party. i think twitter automatically assumes ___isoverparty is a kpop thing im so confused none of us kpop stans know whats going on or are engaging in this i hadnt seen \"isoverparty\" in MONTHS and out of nowhere in the past months I've seen literally at least ONE trending every day... call it what it is, BOREDOM. y'all aren't canceling people for valid reasons y'all are just pulling stuff from a decade ago and saying that they I swear if I see another damn type hashtag trending I will do something irrational When the Kpop fans make Kpop Is over party trend for the nth time to revel in how annoying they are... rubs temples I like the songs but this juvenile fan base.: eek they've got nothing to do, I've seen like of these isoverparty hashtag, I can't take them seriously Whenever I see a someone is over party its always either made drama and nothing actually happened, or its someone who has been a known piece of shit for years and people didnt care but some petty drama thats not even important was apparently the final straw Honestly thinking about uninstalling twitter. It's just so toxic and honest to god this entire \"____ is over party\" bullshit is exhausting. Y'all just can't go a fucking month without finding something to bitch about I'm sorry but it's just fucking stupid. i really hate seeing the ... is over party tweets on my timeline, i just dont think theyre necessary and they make twitter so toxic waking up to see shane dawson is over party trending yall im Tiredt. hes apologized for his racist tyrants but yall still stan robert downey jr who has never apologized for black face so ? pick one I was browsing the -isoverparty hashtag of the day this morning and I saw a fancam of a character I created for my old work and I really lost my shit. Someone liked something I created so much they made,, a fancam. has lost all meaning and is only used by idiots looking to connect with other idiots. Get a fucking hobby you petulant children. yall do understand doing a ...isoverparty not gonna do shit jusko araw araw na lang may is over party Oh look, another day, another \"is over party\" hashtag trending. It's like the worst part of is the only part that continues operating as normal during the pandemic. im sick of seeing these tags _____ isoverparty every single fucking day. and most of the time its for something thats not even offensive, or that happened in the early s Sorry any Kpop stans that follow me. I know not everyone is like this, but when I see Whoever trending, IN THE KPOP community, Im not taking it serious. why are kpop stans always blamed for everything like the shane dawson is over party hashtag mane it was anime twt that started it why yall put thr blame on us I really wish there was a way to block trends, because these \"isoverparty\" hashtags literally every other day is getting so tired... shane dawson is over party is trending and NOT for the reasons it should be. why is no one talking about his support for trisha paytas??? the girl who bullied dissociaDID and makes fun of marginalized communities??? speak tf up please I'm really getting sick of the \"such and such is over party\" hashtags that keep trending on the sidebarLike, they're all either kpop stans posting fancams, people bitching about kpop stans posting fancams and people like \"they deserved it the last times!\" Crazy that shane dawson is over party is trending AGAIN but will never be out of the spotlight no matter how many times theyre cancelled. Not sure how u lot are happy to let racists and trolls earn bank just because they upload a min apology video and theyre sO NiCe NoW Every time I see a ____isoverparty Man I do not care about him I just hate seeing the **** is over party hashtag everytime trending best believe its the kpop stans The \"isoverparty\" people are the new \"-gate\" people, and I'm not here for it. Such an over-used way to infer controversy and usually it lacks useful information. um if yall saw me using the shane dawson is over party hashtag for views on papas fancams you didnt see it ok? MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SEE \"IS OVER PARTY\" HASHTAG IN A SINGLE WEEK?! if you take part in any of the ___isOverParty shit when its not someone actually being awful, i hate you. Dont wanna hear any of that Hate is a strong word bullshit. its an ACCURATE word and you deserve to trip on a sidewalk and break all of your front teeth on the curb. why is shane dawnson is over party a trend? twitter likes to categorize \"____isoverparty\" tweets as kpop for some reason Aye am sure Oliver tree is over party is a tradition when yer gran gets cancer get to yer bed ya simp why? I dont understand, who is the one God of all the kpop accounts that manages to start the ___isoverparty ? ???? Is there a chan for kpop stans starting these twitter apocalypses? I agree its racist but what are we gonna do now? Canceling has almost never worked. Joji, James Charles, they both came out unscathed because canceling doesnt do shit. The whole thing is getting old fast I should learn to ignore those \"x is over party\" trends. I remember this from the last shane is over party, his fans crawled right back up his ass I agree if you want some \" Is over party\" Make a website for you people called WWW.isoverforkpopsandbts,com/fatstans. everytime i see _____isoverparty trending under kp*p i just laugh no matter who it is bc if you think about it, so many of their idols would have scandals too if their lives weren't dictated by their producers ur all invited to the johnny seo is over party I didn't think it was possible, but I've found something more irksome than randomly placed kpop clips ... the terms \"cancel\" and \"**insert name here** is over party\". can we like cancel people for tweeting ___ is over party but they really dont talk about what the celebrities did, they just want to promote their fave... we aint cancelling for you to promote your faves hun. we cancel because of their nasty attitudes Not really ____isoverparty's are just annoying and make most people care less. not another kpop \"blank is over party\" hashtag My new goal in life is become famous enough that kpop Twitter gives me a isoverparty hashtag for no reason like they do everyone else yaya is over party twitter has started putting kpop on all of the -isoverparty trends so you know if your time is being wasted or not didnt joji is over party happen like a few days ago ____________ is over party. Digital foundry is over party so after looking at the tag again i see a lot of you guys saying \"oh look everyone blaming us for the tag\" and then putting the shane dawson is over party tag. doin that makes it more popular kinda like yall want attention. maybe i think of it wrong but its :25 and im tired see i know the shane dawson is over party trend is clickbait but we really should talk about how people keep giving him a pass on all the awful shit hes done :/// Private Art schools are way more expensive then any University.

Getting cancelled on twitter is like getting sent to your room for a day. lmao really need the ____isoverparty trend to stop because i have no self-control and fall into the rabbit hole EVERY TIME Why is over party I like it so far but the only thing is no concert Im dying everyday I different isoverparty is trending and just.. how bored are you guys And I would like to add, on all those stupid this person is over party I see an equal amount of kpop fancams and actors fancams, in fact Ive seen way more actors fancams than kpop ones. lmao \"kpop stans is over party\" their tactics have become their enemy That isn't the point though. Imagine how they feel when they see their name trending with \"isoverparty\" next to it. It causes extreme emotional distress to people when they first see it only to find out people want views, it isn't right... Whenever I go and look through a [person with fame] is over party tag I tend to notice an overwhelming amount of Kpop fans despite them knowing nothing. Example: Saltydkdan I swear there is always a new _______isoverparty everyday at this point. too bad the toxic part IS the loudest part of your community that brings every in existence which rubs a lot of people in the wrong way and basically leads to everyone hating on your community auronplay is over party book!alec is over party stan tv!alec for clear skin high grades and a better quality life I think the problem is every other day I am on twitter, I see some one is over party trending, and it all stems from k-pop stans Every time I see a _____ is over party I can feel my brain shutting down. Its always someone trying to end someone/thing for petty shit that either happened + years ago or is something that shouldve been handled in private. Folks really just want clout. Yeah some kpop stans started the previous blahblah is over party and now their getting it. I don't even know what the fuck is going on with twitter anymore ,full of fights and shits \"/kpopstansareoverparty\" shut up shut the Fuck Up i know its just gonna be full of kpop stans sharing their fancams like every other ___isoverparty when will they realise they are incredibly annoying. shut the fuck up Can we make a moodboard of the daily ___isoverparty cal is over party Then why some of you(kpop stans) making nla bla bla is over party??? Isn't it bad? Making other artist feel bad another day, another someone-is-over party. you'd think ppl have better things to do but nah We promoting fan cams to but not putting other artist down Not posting it with bla bla bla is over party like other kpop stans do of course, kpop stans arent the only people that try to cancel celebrities, and most kpop fans dont do that, its just that most of the time when i see ___isoverparty on the trending tab, its usually the vocal minority of kpop stans at the forefront really? Another \"isoverparty\" is trending? Don't you twitterlings have anything better to do than to stir hate towards everything you disagree with? can yall stop doing these \"-isoverparty\" tags???? BECAUSE THEY DONT FUCKING WORKING. no one \"cancelled\" JOJI AND U CANT CANCELL A WHOLE COUNTRIES POP CULTURE DNCNDKDNCJCNFDKD SHUT UPP AHHHHHHH . i hate kpop this is the third(???) time I've seen kpop is over party trending during quarantine Second of all, wenn jemand nervt, wird der immediately geclownt und man macht keine is over party draus i guess Ok first things first Amaterasu did nothing wrong.

DOES IT FEEL GOOD?? im so confused i just woke up and saw a TON of /___isoverparty tags trending. Can we just stop all of these kinda tags? They are only harmful at the end of the day and people get angry w/ each other about them = pointless argument fuel. Lets just all vibe in kindness please. rock is over party as annoying as kpop stannies can be cancel culture is still fucked and Im getting a bit sick of seeing ....isoverparty trending every other day!! Lol every week somebodys saying blahblah is over party and its just people who are lazy and bored. Its sad to see how sasangs and Koreaboos ruin things for normal kpop fans who are just showing support for their favorite artists. Its hard to tell there are good ones when the loud majority of them are sending death threats to people who have stated they dislike kpop with fan cams attached, and have a trending every week Tom is over party Kpop stans regularly use '...isoverparty' hashtag, but as soon as it's used on them it's a 'dead meme' and 'we're all clowns' ffs Almost Every single hashtag that has was caused by kpop stans lmao, i am not gonna have a list saved for you more like twink felix is over party lets welcome leather jacket daddy felix me waiting patiently for the day i won't see 'isoverparty' trending on here gwendolyn is over party I would say that % of the hashtags X isoverparty comes from them sooo Mochinuko is over party i mean at least locals have improved in something !! its not kpop is over party but kpop STANS are over party Quick question: why is it when a kpop idol says the n word, does black face, talk down on black skin they are never canceled why dont they ever get a *insert name* is over party?

People in the replies are at least centered around K-Pop (not necessarily stans cos I know you'll try to call me out on 'ThEy ArEn'T eVeN ReAl StAnS' bullshit). How do you counter against that, cos clearly people DO care. they want to trend \"covid is over party\" and mother nature is like, \"ya'll hear summthin'?\" I also hate the whole thing, and fans can be annoying. But I find it unfair that theres a lot of misleading information on how this whole thing started. Its causing a lot of unnecessary hate. Many fans are also unaware to the situation/have nothing to do with this Tbh, I agree. I am a joji fan and really dislike it when kpop stans do the \"[name]isoverparty\" thing but I honestly personally saw like s defending comments about joji and then literally only that one thread of that girl that said coon that stated he needed to be cancelled can we start the anime is over party yet? is over party!

It's annoying. Use those hashtags when the person actually deserves to be cancelled. Just to inform fans when you are doing the -Horan- is -over -party and you are doing it altogether your helping BTS fans get it trending if you do it dont put it together i cannot express the about of hatred i have for the people who start the \"_______ is over party\" hashtags without any reason. I don't know what loser is in charge of Twitter's \"[insert randomly selected celebrity here]isoverparty,\" but if I see one more this week I'm going to track them down and shit in their pillowcase. if i see one more fucking \"isoverparty\" tag trending- istg everytime i see \"so and so isoverparty\" i lose more faith in humanity the amount of times I've seen \"... is over party\" on my tl is kinda scary. y not jus stop interacting w them, make it apparent what they've done, nd move on w ur life (i'm gonna regret this later but i'm jus saying, cancel culture is toxic nd doesn't help anything at all) Everyones saying he was rude, which he wasnt and kpop fans started trending Niall Horan is over party for the sole purpose of getting views for the fancams joe is over party So it's a King Bach is over party now because people just think someone is funnier? Here's a hot take, people find different people funny! Calm down Twitter. girl boss \"feminism\" is over party This isoverparty hashtag format is so wack. its not catchy. it dont even slap. Can we make an isoverparty for this getting old Heck. You know you're tired when you read this as, \"Brock Samson is Over Party\"... how do i mute every \"_ is over party\" hash tag no one is over party. NO ONE. im sick of it. Everyday is a new poetic ive seen so many ______ is over party tweets today i think its finally time to burn this bitch to the ground, you had a good run twitter. everytime I hop on twitter theres always a ____________isoverparty thats trending like damn yall need to calm down sometimes I'll just start screen shotting everytime I see something that says (thisperson)isoverparty Those tags make me want to jump off the jersey bridge papel carbon cancelado papel carbon is over party May have not been doing anything wrong, but this is something I see every damn time one of these \"x is over party\" trends pop up. In this reply, it just seems like the person was being incredibly condescending. Another \"is over party\" lmao. Can't wait until they aren't over and gain more fans because, you know, that's how literally all of these \"is over party\" or \"is cancelled\" trends happen to play out. I love when \"is cancelled\" or \"is over party\" hashtags trend because it always works out in favor of the person being cancelled lmao. They always wind up gaining thousands of fans. It's just kinda funny how it always works out that way. Something similar to this pops up anytime I click the _____isoverparty everyday there is a \"x isoverparty\" hashtag. did they actually do some shit? its hit or miss. trying to join the brockhampton is over party with my screenshot of Kevin Abstract saying some sus shit to me when I was but I have too many pics of my ass Get stans and K-pop fans off this fucking app. Yet another celebrity gets the hashtag is over party. Guess what? Theres no evidence to back up these accusations. Cuz thats all they are; accusations. i legit saw is over party hashtags and honestly its not even funny anymore its just tiring to see people so hungry to tear someones career down is the new stoopid thing twitter does is have [insert random celeb]isoverparty everynight at around am?? yall need more hobbies Everyone doing and the other (blank)isoverparty , refer to this tweet. Kpop Twitter throwing darts to determine the next \"[blank]isoverparty\" hashtag: dude trust me it'll work this time people won't just immediately ignore it and dunk on us for being annoying we'll get fancam views and fuck with someone in a meaningful way can we get at least a whole f*cking week without a something is over party? brockhampton is over party...welp i stopped listening to them anyway, I like dominic fike and omar apollo better Whenever Us the Hashtag Bucky Barnes, Bucky Barnes is over Party comes up as well, whoever has decided to Start Bucky Barnes is Over Party Trending is crazy and should seriously go back and rewatch all the Captain America Films and realise that Bucky is awesome People seem to love throwing parties online! I've seen at least three [insert name here] is over party in the trending tap this week. My reaction to % of the \"_______IsOverParty\" trends on Twitter. if i see one more \"trends for you\" hashtag say \"-------- is over party\" ONE MORE TIME this week i will lose my McFUCKING MIND how come every time theres a new \"____ is over party\" hashtag trending on twitter its about non-white/lgbt/female artists and never any of the cishet emo white dudes yall love to stan... idk it just makes me think why is not on the trending page but the brockhampton is over party is. i worked hard spamming damn this hurts STOP DOING BLANK ISOVERPARTY JUST TO GET CLOUT ON UR FANCAMSthis is why cancel culture has become so toxic IF I SEE ONE MORE *insert name here*isoverparty I YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GO GET A JOB OR A DAMN HOBBY cuz these stan account are canceling a new person every day CUZ THEYRE BORED BRUH STFU W UR BROCKHAMPTON IS OVER PARTY WE DONT CARE locals see a /___isoverparty tag trending in their FOR YOU trends & automatically think its kpop stans even tho the tag full of dusty locals & stans of not-kpop artists find something new Yeah, now that yall remember Tearzah are yall gon start a isoverparty? Because Lowkey I been waitin for it is over party cancel culture is so fucking toxic and annoying. yall really just cancel people as a trend. shut the fuck up. Shakira is over party I loved zootopia why would u hate in benji crayola? I don't know how many times I've seen \"blank\" is over party I swear twitter be cancelling there own moms. do NOT fucking start a niall horan is over party! yall claim to be fans and as soon as he says something, and we dont even know if its him, yall just try to cancel him. TF WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE hes a literal ANGEL. Let's play spin the wheel on which completely random celebrity will be put in front of \"isoverparty\" tomorrow I applaud the tenacity of anti bh twitter they are able to get br0ckh/mptn is over party trending like once a month as new people discover the \"what's wrong with b*\" thread (allegations of which I have assumed are true) this is like the th [blank] is over party hashtag trending today is over party investigate this man yall, niall is continuously retweeting that the whole thing with modest isnt true. he lived it. if you should be believing anyone its him. also wtf is up with the niall horgan is over party tag? this one.. so glad i literally never know any of the people in any given x is over party trending hashtag At this point the ____ is over party is only for people to spam their annoying ass fancams i cant barely find what acutally happend at all why do i see an is over party hashtag trending Every Single Fucking Day Literally every single another annoying tag that I want to mute but is impossible to is the [insert random celebrity here]ISOVERPARTY every time i log on twitter i see trending like what dont yall get better shit to do rather than cancel people every hour of every day theres a new \"x is over party\" like i get yall are bored in quarantine but please find a hobby where's my fucking ___isoverparty hashtag????? inconsiderate motherfuckers There have been so many ____isoverparty hashtags since the start of quarantine that nobody is going to believe a single one after how many of them turned out to be utter nonsense. Good luck getting anyone to even bother looking into your stupid witchhunt BS now. lmao i'm offended bc the toy story movies have been some of my literal favs since forever skjfhf lmao calum hood is over party People are literally just throwing these \"_____isoverparty\" around with any celebrity they find. Like grow up and think for yourself. Imagine being so brainwashed you believe everything you see on the internet. Tragic. Why do people still bother staning real people? Its problematic to worship anybody and put that pressure on them; they will always disappoint you. I see a blank is over party on Twitter every damn day. Stan fictional characters instead. What if someone said Cancel EXO o Cancel Bangtan, SuperM, SM. LIKE WE LITERALLY DID A SM IS OVER PARTY AND YOU DID NOTHING TI WORRY ABOUT SM ARTISTA YOU DID NOTHIN TO CANCEL SM BUT YOU RE CANCELLING ONE PERSON? YOU IDIOTS I'm pretty sure that there's a different {insert famous person here}isoverparty hashtag literally everyday, but it kinda looks like nothing happens to whoever the cancelee of the day is, so what's the point? is twt that damn bored that they trend x is over party every day i bet yall i could fake some screenshots on some random famous person rn and get an entire tag going on.\n"
